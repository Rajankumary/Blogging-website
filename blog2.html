        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">4. Development</h2>
        <p>
            In February 2004, Lionsgate acquired the film rights for Black Widow, and in April announced David Hayter as writer and director of the film, with Marvel Studios' Avi Arad producing. By June 2006, Lionsgate had dropped the project and the rights reverted to Marvel Studios. Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter "never felt comfortable that we had found a place that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously". This left Hayter "heartbroken", but he hoped the film would be made "some day".</p>

            <p>Marvel entered early talks with Emily Blunt to play Black Widow in Iron Man 2 (2010) in January 2009,[61] but she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in Gulliver's Travels (2010).[62] In March 2009, Scarlett Johansson signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films.
